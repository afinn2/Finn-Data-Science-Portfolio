# Finn-Data-Science-Portfolio
**HI!** My name is Aidan F. and this is where I will house my Intro to DS Projects.

*A bit about me:* I am a graduating Senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Classics with a minor in data science. I hope the skills I learn in the Intro to DS class, and in the minor in general, will allow me to be a more valuable worker no matter the field I choose. Aside from academic and professional stuff, I love love love playing board and card games with (especially euchre) with friends and spend much of my time captaining my university's mens developmental Ultimate Frisbee team.

**Tidy Data Project**
- https://github.com/afinn2/Finn-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData_Project
- This project focused on teaching me how to tidy data to achieve a standardized look. I used methods like melt and pivot and created a pie chart and several bar charts.
- This project marks another step in my capabilties to transform data in a professional manner and to draw out/highlight patterns contained within the data. I now have the basics of both data cleaning and tidying (if only I had those fundamentals for my dorm room :))

## Super Cool Visualizations
**From Tidy Data:** This is where I learned that my dataset had pre-made buckets of medaling-events so each athlete appeared to only win one medal.

**Machine Learning Project**
- https://github.com/afinn2/Finn-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp
- This project had me create an app with Streamlit that allows users to run a machine learning algorithm on two preuploaded datasets or one they can import themselves. The user can also choose to run either a regresson or classification model on their dataset, whichever fits best. The app displays the performance of each model with a combination of visualizations and metrics.
- Below is an example of a performance display:
